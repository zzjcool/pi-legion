Published GitHub Release notes remain available at
https://github.com/zzjcool/pi-legion/releases — this file is the in-repo
summary so you can see **2.x vs 0.16** without leaving the tree.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- TUI context viewer (status-bar / railway click): floating modal with dim mask,
  title bar marking **主** vs **子**, and Esc / mask / Esc-hint close without
  retire or stop (#147).

## [2.0.3] — 2026-10-15

### Fixed

- `maxChildrenPerNode` only counts **live/running** children; `retire` (including
  Already-retired no-op) frees the budget slot so a full tree can launch again
  after retire. Session keep for resume does **not** occupy the concurrent slot
  (#142 / #143).
- Header tok/s uses `MIN_RATE_GENERATION_MS=1000` (same floor as tree rows): when
  the in-window generation delta is under 1s, fall back to wall-clock so tiny
  `dGen` cannot explode rates into the millions (#140 / #141).

## [2.0.2] — 2026-10-16

### Fixed

- Child worktree launches are suppressed when the parent checkout is itself a
  linked git worktree (`git-dir` ≠ `git-common-dir`): role defaults and unset
  launch flags collapse to `worktree: false`, matching the centurion-child
  precedent. Explicit `launch: true` / per-child `step` flags still win.
- `worktreeBootstrap: "npm-install"` no longer fires `npm install` on a stray
  `package.json` without a lockfile (observed: Java/Maven repos carrying
  package.json for docs/tooling); without a lockfile the mode records the
  marker and skips, so non-npm worktrees launch instead of failing after the
  10-minute bootstrap budget.

### Fixed in 2.0.1 (inherited from prior entries)

- Railway / `/legion` header "now" tok/s is 0 when no agent is running; only live nodes count toward now (chart buckets still use the full trailing window) (#136).
- Narrow/stacked `/legion` header truncates long run + selection badges without overwriting `⚔ /legion`; galaxy legend reserves room for failed/retired glyphs before roles (#125).
- Galaxy legend `statusBudget` counts grapheme cells (not `String.length`); selection badge min width unified for portrait + landscape (#128).
- Dispatched children now receive `--provider` pinned from the parent's model
  registry, so a bare model id (`workbuddy/…`) that also exists under a static
  auth-less provider in `models.json` can no longer hijack the child start
  (`No API key found for …`) (#123).
- Scout-guard now counts first-class `grep` / `find` / `ls` tool calls as reads (#87).
- Doctor diagnose help no longer repeats itself; storage section shows hygiene sweep state (#86).
- Bundled roles no longer advertise unloaded `lens_*` tools (#75).
- Non-interactive `pi --print` waits for async children before cascade retire (#77).
- Roles load `builtin:codemode`; doctor diagnose shows a dedicated section (#89 / #90 → #93).
- Doctor role-tool→extension gates are data-driven / extensible (#97 / #99).
- Launch honors `name=` so `/legion status <name>` matches the railway label (#101 / #104).
- Galaxy legend shows failed/retired glyphs only when those states are present (#102 / #103).
- Live child status leads with `alive · quiet Ns`; long quiet emphasizes living over a stale execution snapshot (#81 / #92 / #105).
- npm `package.json` description/keywords aligned with Legion 2.x RPC (no Herdr panes) (#106 / #111).

### Added

- `/legion status` human-readable summary; doctor slash list covers team / agents / on|off / summary (#76).
- README documents scout-guard settings and `/scout-guard` / `/no-scout-guard` (#74 / #71).
- Scout-guard mock-llm e2e: notify ×1, cooldown, and dispatch clear (#108 / #113).

### Changed

- Esc no longer retires children; only `/legion stop` or session exit retires (esc-no-retire-v3, #134).
- Status strip shows a persistent `/legion stop` hint while children are live (railway + tree; width may truncate) (#134).
- Prefer `PI_LEGION_EXTRA_AGENT_DIRS` over legacy `PI_HERDR_SUBAGENTS_*` (alias; new name wins if both set) (#109 / #114).
- CONTRIBUTING/CI docs aligned with 2.x RPC; verify-12/13 paths point at `test/legacy/docker/` (#95 / #100, #107 / #112).
- README: remove duplicate Child extensions heading (#94 / #98).
- `design.md` historical banner; landed F38–F46 marked ✅ / Historical (#80 / #83 → #91).
- CI PR job runs `test:integration` (#79 / #88).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-10-14

First **Pi Legion** line on headless Pi RPC. Relative to the final Herdr-era
**0.16.x** packages, this is a breaking transport and packaging change.

### Breaking

- **RPC-only transport:** children run as headless `pi --mode rpc` processes
  under `LegionSupervisor`. Herdr pane execution is archived under
  `src/backends/legacy/` and is **not** a v2 runtime option.
- **Kinds:** only `kind: pi` is supported. Migrate non-Pi roles or stay on
  `pi-legion@0.16.x`.
- **Shared tree ledger:** squad state lives in SQLite WAL `legion.db` (phases,
  mail, resume), not pane-centric session bookkeeping alone.
- Bundled agent playbooks aligned with local RPC practice (#66).

### Added

- Recursive centurion trees, four-phase
  planning / implementing / reviewing / verifying machine, `legion_mail`,
  three-layer `/legion` UI (resident tree, full view, live overlay), railway
  strip, tok/s / galaxy / log panels.
- Scout-guard: remind the main session after a streak of read-class tools (#64).
- Storage hygiene sweep on startup: prune idle runs, orphan temp dirs, abandoned
  nodes, event retention, WAL checkpoint (#37 / #38 / #40 → #47).
- `/legion doctor` (+ diagnose) self-check; auto-doctor snippets on gated spawn
  failures (#52).
- Child memory gate (`NODE_OPTIONS` V8 flags, pre-spawn gate) and tree-wide
  verify concurrency limit (#50).
- Children default to `--no-extensions` with explicit/role escape hatches (#43 / #48).
- User stop controls for async children (`/legion stop`, idle Esc, `x` in view) (#41).
- Mock LLM server for offline pi / legion smoke (`test/mock-llm`, #54 / #56).
- GitHub Actions CI (typecheck + unit + integration) and stage-only npm publish
  on tag (#65 / #68).
- Project workflow docs in CONTRIBUTING (#69).

### Changed

- Slash commands consolidated under `/legion` (#57).
- Status bar shows current-turn elapsed beside lifetime total (#62).
- tok/s uses output tokens / generationMs (decode throughput) (#61).

### Fixed

- Railway: pin live spawn verticals when the strip scrolls left (#67); retire /
  downward spawn connector regressions (#46).
- Live worker no longer marked retired on a transient Connection blip (#63).
- Session JSONL streamed + incrementally parsed (no full-file `readFileSync`) (#36 / #45).
- Per-stream child output byte cap; kill on overflow (#35 / #44).
- Bun SQLite `.get()` null treated as miss on root insert (#53).
- Vexillatio sibling naming scoped to the current parent (#42 / #51).

### Security / robustness (design.md F38–F46, already on master)

- Model-scope globs use non-RegExp matching (ReDoS).
- Session create uses `writeFileSync` with `wx` (no fd leak / TOCTOU).
- Session decode swallows scalar JSON lines as torn.
- `tasks[]` / blank task validated before launch.
- Per-agent `timeoutMs`, pending criteria, nested YAML acceptance parsing;
  `UNENFORCED_FIELDS` empty.

## [0.16.x] - Herdr-era (final)

Last line that runs children in Herdr panes. Not developed further on this
branch — pin `pi-legion@0.16.x` if you still need that model. See
[Herdr transition](README.md#herdr-transition-and-role-migration) in the README.

Earlier 0.11–0.15 history (including the `pi-herdr-swarm` /
`@zzjcool/pi-herdr-subagents` renames) lives in git tags and older Releases.
